# CGE-AZ Lab Setup Guide

Do this once, before Lab 1. Total time: ~20 minutes of work, plus a few waits.
Every step here exists because skipping it broke a real lab run on a real fresh
account — see [VALIDATION-LOG.md](VALIDATION-LOG.md) for the receipts.

## 0. What you need

- **An Azure free account** — [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
  You get **USD 200 of credit for your first 30 days**, free monthly amounts of 20+
  services for 12 months, 65+ always-free services, and **spending protection**: your
  card is never charged unless you deliberately upgrade to pay-as-you-go.
- **Azure CLI** (`brew install azure-cli` / [install docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)) — validated on 2.90.
- **Terraform >= 1.9** (`brew install terraform`) — validated on 1.14.
- **Python 3.11+** with `pip`.
- **A GitHub account** and `git`.
- Domain 6 also uses **conftest** (`brew install conftest`).

## 0b. Already an Azure customer? (no $200 credit for you — here's the real cost)

The free-account credit is for brand-new accounts only. If your card is already
registered with Azure (first learner to hit this: launch day), you run the labs
pay-as-you-go — and that is fine, because the pipeline is deliberately cheap:

- The **Defender for Cloud 30-day trial** is per subscription, per plan, on first
  enablement — you still get it. Consider a fresh subscription in your existing
  tenant for a clean sandbox.
- Everything else is serverless or consumption tier: Cosmos DB serverless,
  Y1 Functions (the free monthly grant usually covers the course), LRS storage,
  and a small Log Analytics ingest. Torn down on schedule, the whole course
  typically lands under a few dollars.
- The budget alert in Lab 1 is not optional for you — it's your only spending
  protection, since pay-as-you-go has no free-account safety net.
- Run history for the capstone: keep the timers alive until you submit, tear
  down after the score comes back. The grader reads run history from your
  evidence store, so submit first, then tear down.

## 1. Timing strategy — read this before creating anything

Two 30-day clocks matter, and you start both:

1. **The $200 credit clock** starts when you create the free account.
2. **The Defender trial clock** starts in Lab 2 when you enable your first paid plan.

Create the account when you're ready to actually take the course, do Lab 2 within the
first few days, and both windows comfortably cover Labs 2–6 and the capstone. If life
interrupts you mid-course, that's fine — everything except the one Defender plan is
free-tier, and the teardown script kills the plan in one command.

**One more clock:** Defender's *first assessment cycle* on a brand-new subscription can
take several hours to ~24h. Lab 2 sets this expectation; don't panic at an empty
assessments API on day one.

## 2. Sign in and register resource providers

```bash
az login
az account show   # confirm the right subscription
```

Fresh subscriptions have almost every resource provider **unregistered**, which produces
confusing errors deep into the labs. Register the eight the course uses now:

```bash
for ns in Microsoft.Management Microsoft.OperationalInsights Microsoft.Security \
          Microsoft.DocumentDB Microsoft.Web Microsoft.Storage Microsoft.Insights \
          Microsoft.PolicyInsights; do
  az provider register --namespace $ns
done
```

Registration takes ~2–3 minutes; check with
`az provider list --query "[?registrationState=='Registering'].namespace"` — empty means done.

## 3. Fork and clone the repo

Fork `github.com/GRCEngClub/cgeaz` to your own account, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/cgeaz.git
cd cgeaz
```

Every lab lives in `labs/`, every pipeline stage in `stages/`.

## 4. Know the regional quirks (validated 2026-09)

- **Consumption-plan (Y1) quota is regional and ZERO in most US regions on free
  accounts.** In validation, `centralus` and `westus3` worked; eastus, eastus2, westus2,
  southcentralus, northcentralus did not. Before Lab 4, run:

  ```bash
  ./labs/00-setup/probe-quota.sh
  ```

  and set `functions_location` (stages 03/04) to a region marked OK.
- **East US frequently lacks Cosmos DB capacity** for new subscriptions. The evidence
  store defaults to `eastus2` for this reason. Leave it unless it fails, then pick
  another region.

## 5. Known CLI potholes (already routed around in the labs)

| Symptom | Cause | The lab's fix |
|---|---|---|
| `az consumption budget create` → 400 | CLI uses a retired API | Lab 1 uses `az rest` (script provided) |
| `az monitor diagnostic-settings create` → `KeyError: resource_group` at subscription scope | CLI parsing bug | Lab 2 uses `az rest` (script provided) |
| `terraform init` → 403 `AuthorizationPermissionMismatch` on brand-new state storage | Blob **data-plane** role just granted; RBAC propagation | Wait 1–3 minutes and retry — bootstrap.sh warns you |
| First management group creation hangs a couple of minutes | Tenant root group being provisioned | Wait; do not re-run |
| Assessments API returns `[]` on a new subscription | Defender's first cycle hasn't run | Expected — see timing strategy above |

## 6. Cost guardrails (defense in depth for your wallet)

Three layers, in order of who saves you:

1. **Spending protection** — free accounts don't charge your card unless you upgrade.
2. **The $200 credit** — absorbs anything the free tiers don't.
3. **Your Lab 1 budget alert** — $10/month with actual + forecast alerts, so you hear
   about a runaway before it matters.

Validated lab-run costs: everything except the Defender for Storage trial is free tier or
pennies (Cosmos serverless, consumption Functions, one Log Analytics workspace at PerGB2018
with lab-scale ingestion). Teardown scripts exist in every lab folder; the course-end
teardown is `terraform destroy` per stage, in reverse order (06 → 04 → 03 → 01).

## 7. Windows / Git Bash notes

> Setting up a Windows machine from scratch (Azure CLI, Terraform, Python,
> conftest, PowerShell-native provider registration)? Follow
> **[SETUP-WINDOWS.md](SETUP-WINDOWS.md)** — a launch-day learner contribution —
> then come back here for the Git Bash quirks below.

The labs are written for a POSIX shell. On Windows, Git Bash covers almost everything,
with three things to know up front (each lab repeats the note where it bites):

1. **Path mangling on resource IDs.** Git Bash rewrites arguments that start with `/`
   into Windows paths, which corrupts Azure resource IDs (`--scope /subscriptions/...`,
   `terraform import /providers/...`). Disable it for your session before Lab 1:

   ```bash
   export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
   ```

2. **No `zip` command.** Labs 4 and 5 zip the function code. Git Bash does not ship
   `zip`; use 7-Zip (`7z a /tmp/collector.zip .`) or run those two steps from WSL.
   Either way, zip the directory *contents* so `host.json` sits at the archive root.

3. **`date` is GNU.** The budget script's `date -d "+2 years"` fallback works in
   Git Bash as-is; nothing to change.

WSL (Ubuntu) needs none of the above and matches the validated environment most
closely; if you already have it, prefer it.

You're ready. Start with `labs/01-sandbox`.

## 8. Linux notes — rolling-release distros (Kali, Arch, etc.)

Two real failure modes from a launch-day learner on Kali (thank you, Lee), both
Python packaging problems rather than Azure ones:

1. **`az` breaks with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
   'azure.mgmt.resource...'`** — a system-wide `pip install` clobbered a
   dependency the apt-installed CLI needed (the `azure` namespace package is
   shared across ~300 azure-mgmt-* packages, so whichever install wins,
   everyone gets). Don't reconcile versions in system site-packages; give the
   CLI its own venv:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/az-cli-venv
   ~/.local/share/az-cli-venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
   ~/.local/share/az-cli-venv/bin/pip install "azure-cli==2.90.0"
   ln -sf ~/.local/share/az-cli-venv/bin/az ~/.local/bin/az
   ```

   (Avoid `pipx install azure-cli` — it has resolved to an ancient release and
   its launcher shells out to the system `python`, reintroducing the conflict.)

2. **The venv later breaks with `No module named 'azure'`** — rolling-release
   distros repoint `/usr/bin/python3` on ordinary upgrades, and a venv's
   `bin/python3` is a symlink to that movable target, so its site-packages
   directory stops matching the interpreter version. Pin the venv to the exact
   interpreter it was built with:

   ```bash
   ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.13 ~/.local/share/az-cli-venv/bin/python3
   ```

   On fixed-release distros (Debian stable, Ubuntu LTS) this doesn't happen —
   the default python3 doesn't move between releases.

## Appendix: how the CI workflows get credentials

They don't — not in this repo. The upstream repo is **deliberately unarmed**: its
workflows skip until `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is set, and it never will be here, because on
a public repo the `pull_request` OIDC subject matches PRs from any fork. Each learner
arms **their own fork** against **their own sandbox subscription** in Lab 6 with
`labs/06-loop/arm-your-fork.sh`, which creates a fork-scoped OIDC federation and
prints the five repository variables to add. No secrets exist anywhere in this design:
OIDC exchanges short-lived tokens against a federation that names your fork alone.
Hardening the granted role (Contributor → a plan-only custom role) is a worthwhile
production exercise — and a good community PR.
